How do we approach the Newey-West adjustment? In the seminar there are hardcoded 4/6 lags

Correlation between beta and size is negative, weird right?

May need to add the average portfolios for bivariate sort

Bivariate sort returns strange warning. Likely a vector of NAs is passes to min and max - BUT WHERE??!!

Add magnitude effects to Fama-MacBeth (how a var changes with one std dev, difference between IQR etc.)

Check and resolve warnings
